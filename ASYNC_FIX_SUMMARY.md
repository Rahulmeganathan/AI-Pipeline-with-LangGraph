# Async Fix Summary: nest_asyncio Solution

## Problem
The Streamlit app was encountering `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'ScriptRunner.scriptThread'` when trying to run async operations from LangChain and LangGraph.

## Root Cause
This error occurs when:
- LangChain's async methods are called
- Async HTTP clients are used
- Async database connections are made
- LangGraph's async workflow execution is triggered

All of these happen in a synchronous Streamlit context, causing event loop conflicts.

## Solution: nest_asyncio
The most common and effective fix is using `nest_asyncio`, which allows nested event loops to work properly.

### Implementation

1. **Install nest_asyncio**:
   ```bash
   pip install nest_asyncio
   ```

2. **Apply nest_asyncio in all async services**:
   ```python
   import nest_asyncio
   
   # Apply nest_asyncio to handle nested event loops
   nest_asyncio.apply()
   ```

3. **Files Updated**:
   - `src/graph/agent_graph.py` - Added nest_asyncio import and apply()
   - `src/llm/llm_service.py` - Added nest_asyncio import and apply()
   - `src/rag/rag_service.py` - Added nest_asyncio import and apply()
   - `requirements.txt` - Added `nest_asyncio>=1.5.8`

### Benefits of nest_asyncio Solution

1. **Simple**: Just import and apply - no complex event loop handling
2. **Reliable**: Standard solution used by many async libraries
3. **Clean**: Removes all the complex `_run_async_in_sync_context` methods
4. **Compatible**: Works with LangChain, LangGraph, and Streamlit
5. **Maintainable**: Much easier to understand and debug

### Before vs After

**Before (Complex Event Loop Handling)**:
```python
def _run_async_in_sync_context(self, coro):
    """Complex event loop handling with multiple fallbacks"""
    try:
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        return asyncio.run(coro)
    except RuntimeError:
        try:
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            if loop.is_closed():
                return asyncio.run(coro)
            else:
                return loop.run_until_complete(coro)
        except RuntimeError:
            return asyncio.run(coro)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️  Async handling failed: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

**After (nest_asyncio)**:
```python
import nest_asyncio

# Apply nest_asyncio to handle nested event loops
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Now async calls work directly
response = self.llm.invoke(messages)
```

### Testing Results

✅ **All components initialize successfully**
✅ **Query classification works**
✅ **Agent graph processes queries**
✅ **Streamlit app imports without errors**
✅ **No more async runtime errors**

### Usage

The Streamlit app can now be run normally:
```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app_enhanced.py
```

The `nest_asyncio` solution is the industry standard for handling async operations in synchronous contexts like Streamlit, and it's much more reliable than custom event loop management.
