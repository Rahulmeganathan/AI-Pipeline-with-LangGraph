# 📄 Dynamic PDF Upload Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

Your AI pipeline now supports **dynamic PDF upload** where users can upload any PDF documents through the Streamlit interface and ask questions about the uploaded content.

## 🚀 **How to Use the Enhanced App**

### **Step 1: Start the Enhanced Streamlit App**

```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app_enhanced.py
```

### **Step 2: Initialize the System**

1. **Open the app** in your browser
2. **Click "🚀 Initialize System"** in the sidebar

3. **Click "📤 Process Uploaded Documents"**
4. **Wait for processing** to complete

### **Step 4: Ask Questions**

Once documents are processed, you can ask questions like:
- "What is machine learning?"
- "Explain the key concepts in the document"
- "What are the main topics covered?"
- "Summarize the content"

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **Example Session:**

```
1. User opens app → System shows initialization button
2. User clicks "Initialize System" → System loads AI components
3. User uploads "research_paper.pdf" → File is saved to session directory
4. User clicks "Process Documents" → PDF is processed and stored in vector DB
5. User asks "What is the main finding?" → RAG system searches and answers
6. User asks "Explain the methodology" → System provides detailed response
```

   - Check internet connection

## 🎯 **Testing the System**

### **Test Script:**
```bash
# Test dynamic PDF processing
python test_dynamic_pdf_upload.py

# Test the full system
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app_enhanced.py
```

### **Manual Testing:**
1. **Upload a PDF** with known content
2. **Ask specific questions** about the content
3. **Verify responses** match the PDF content
4. **Check evaluation metrics** in LangSmith
